Simulated/single-state relativistic physics

“What I cannot create I do not understand” - Feynman
“Everything should be made as simple as possible, but no simpler." - Einstein

Sirelphys is a sandbox that simulates universes of arbitrary size and number of (spatial) dimensions using single-state approximations of relativistic physics
(i.e. the system maintains only a single present state for every object, with no knowledge of an object's past or future). 
Such a simulation cannot and is not designed to authentically simulate our observed universe, as it cannot and almost certainly will never be able to
accurately reproduce various real-world phenomena (quantum mechanics, collisions where relativistic length contraction is relevant etc.). 
Fully simulating a real-time relativistic universe would require a perfectly-efficient quantum computer with at least as much 
entropy as the system being simulated.
In practice, current computers are on the order of a trillion times less efficient than such a perfect quantum computer,
which is why even microscopic short-length full-scale relativistic simulations remain computationally prohibitive.
Stated otherwise, fully-simulating our universe in real-time with our current technology would require a computer the size of one
trillion universes, while simulating a human would require a computer the size of a trillion humans.

In order to reduce the computational requirement to conduct interesting universe simulations, we are then left with two options: 1) simulate
universes with a lower number of spatial dimensions (perhaps not ideal from an interest perspective given that we are starting with only three spatial dimensions), 
or 2) make various approximations to reduce the computation cost of simulating a universe with the same number of spatial dimensions as
our own. Sirelphys it my toy to explore what is possible with the latter approach, when one specifically restricts the simulation to
maintaining a single present state for all entities.

- Add relativistic frames
- Either switch to using quads for all absolute positions or switch to dec (with sufficient precision)
